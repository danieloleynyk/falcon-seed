# go-seed
Production ready golang application template, 
with a containerized dev environment.

Currently I'm supporting debugging using goland.

Roadmap:
  - Add vscode debug support
  - Live Reload using delve
    * Can be achieved but not in debug mode 
  - Basic cicd template for: 
    * gitlab ci
    * github actions
